                        <p>
                            I've been a union organizer since 2019, going back to the olden days
                            when it was a secret! With experience as a shop steward, the
                            current unit secretary, a member of the past bargaining committee,
                            and an officer at our Local (NYGuild), I've seen all sides of
                            building our power (and learned a lot along the way!) I'm running
                            for unit secretary again to ensure that every member's voice is
                            heard.
                        </p>

                        <p>My priorities include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Empowering members to get involved, in whatever way you can
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Seeking your input, to drive our actions
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Keeping resources organized and available to anyone who needs them
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Making sure <em>you</em> find community in <em>your union!</em>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Outside of our unit, I'm active with my town's Disability
                            Commission, served as NewsGuild representative to the CWA
                            Accessibility Working group, and speak about the intersection of
                            disability justice and labor whenever I can. I enjoy quilting,
                            and I have 2 cats: Roger Roger & Maz (pictured).
